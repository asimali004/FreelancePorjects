Now we will create trend-following portfolios. Each month, we will follow an investment strategy that buys the future contract for the top-performing commodity in the previous month, and sells short the lowest-performing commodity in the prior month. (Be sure that you are using last month’s ranking variable and not the coincident ranking variable!) Start by forming a monthly time series for each of these three portfolios. For example, you could create a “Lowest” series and store the lowest ranked return each month into that series, and similarly create a “Middle” and “Highest” series including the appropriate returns. Output a tuple (length = 3) with the arithmetic mean monthly returns for these three portfolios, ordered as (lowest, middle, highest).
